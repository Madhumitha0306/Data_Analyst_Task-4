SQL for Data Analysis – E-commerce Shipping Dataset 🚚📦

📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.  
Using the **E-commerce Shipping dataset** from Kaggle, I explored real-world logistics data to uncover insights into shipment modes, delivery ratings, and customer satisfaction patterns.

All SQL queries were executed within a **Jupyter Notebook environment**, using a **SQLite database** for ease of analysis and visualization.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook
* SQLite (via sqlite3)
* Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
* Kaggle E-commerce Shipping Data

🎯 Objectives
1. Perform SQL-based data analysis on the E-commerce dataset.
2. Use key SQL operations such as:
   - `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
   - `JOIN` operations (`INNER`, `LEFT`, simulated `RIGHT`)
   - Subqueries
   - Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`)
   - Views for reusable analysis
   - Indexesfor query optimization
  
🧠 Learnings
* Hands-on experience integrating SQL with Python for analysis.  
* Writing efficient queries and understanding indexing.  
* Using Jupyter Notebook for combining SQL logic, code, and results in one place.  
* Translating raw datasets into actionable business insights.

🏁 Conclusion

* This project showcased how SQL can be used for effective data analysis on an E-commerce Shipping dataset.
* Key operations like joins, subqueries, aggregates, and views helped uncover shipment and customer insights.
* Indexing improved query performance and data retrieval efficiency.
* Overall, it strengthened my skills in using SQL for real-world data-driven analysis.
